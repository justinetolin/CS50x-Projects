If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
1. Well, aside from danceability, energy, and valence, I would like to consider the tempo. Tempo refers to the beat of the music and a person might probably like some fast beat musics or sometimes cry on some slow ones.


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
2. Using my answer in the previous answer which is considering the tempo in the calculation. I'll set first a range of these values to identify them as slow to fast, maybe some scale of up to 5. Then cosnider the highest frequency in the scale and if, for example, 5 has the highest, then the aurio aura would be kinda bright, happy, and something with good mood. The opposite goes to a 1 in the scale.
